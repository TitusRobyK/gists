Here is a breakdown of the command provided:

- `-w '\nLookup time:\t%{time_namelookup}\nConnect time:\t%{time_connect}\nAppCon time:\t%{time_appconnect}\nRedirect time:\t%{time_redirect}\nPreXfer time:\t%{time_pretransfer}\nStartXfer time:\t%{time_starttransfer}\n\nTotal time:\t%{time_total}\n'`: The `-w` option is followed by a format. It's used to display information on stdout after a completed operation. In this case, it's used to print out various timing statistics:
  - `time_namelookup` is the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the name resolving was completed.
  - `time_connect` is the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.
  - `time_appconnect` is the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the remote host was completed.
  - `time_redirect` is the time, in seconds, it took for all redirection steps including name lookup, connect, pre-transfer, and transfer before the final transaction was started. This is set to 0 if no redirection took place.
  - `time_pretransfer` is the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the file transfer was just about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to the particular protocol(s) involved.
  - `time_starttransfer` is the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the first byte was just about to be transferred. This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the server needed to calculate the result.
  - `time_total` is the total time, in seconds, that the full operation lasted.

- `-o /dev/null`: The `-o` option is used to redirect the output of the command. In this case, the output is being redirected to `/dev/null`, which is a special file that discards all data written to it (i.e., it's sending the output "nowhere").

- `-s`: The `-s` or `--silent` option is used to silence `curl`. When used, it makes `curl` mute, i.e., it doesn't show the progress meter or error messages.

- `https://example.com`: This is the URL that `curl` is interacting with.

So, this command is used to measure and display various connection and data transfer times for a given URL, without showing the actual output or progress information. The output is discarded, and only the connection and data transfer times are printed to the console.
